# Job-Finder
https://mecsimcalc.com/app/9326746/job_finder_app
\\Perry's Victims HackED 2024 repository. 
The inspiration from this project came from the pain of applying to so many jobs, and just wanting to auto apply to jobs that are relevant to our resumes.
A user uploads a resume/cover letter and the model parses key words from the document for keywords for jobs. The user then submits a location and jobs related to the key words parsed are shown in the vicinity.
We built the system off of the MecSimCalc platform. We imported various libraries such as folium, geopy, OpenCage,etc.
